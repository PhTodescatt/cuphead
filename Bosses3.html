            <h3>The first boss of Island 3, Rumor Honeybottoms has a very interesting concept: the setting is a
                hive with several
                small platforms, and this scenario is rising and we must follow this rise to avoid suffering damage
                of the honey that lies just below. All this while we deal with a guard bee in the first phase, the bee
                queen appears in the second with 3 different attacks and at the end she turns into a plane that shoots at Cuphead</h3>

            <h3>The mouse and the cat, known for appearing to be inspired by Tom and Jerry. Werner Werman has simple attacks,
                as a mouse he throws tomatoes and debris from a can, while old bottle caps are thrown at the
                attack, and while the cat tries to attack us with its paw and with ghosts</h3>

            <h3>The boss classified as the most difficult in the game by the community has different types of attacks. Dr. Kahl's
                Robot begins
                with 3 attacks, through the robot's belly, antenna and chest; then it just turns its head, flying to everyone
                the directions as bombs chase us; at the end the Doctor appears in the Robot's head, being a phase
                with very high health and attacks several diamond fragments while we dodge</h3>

                water or
                bombs on the player, and all these attacks can come at the same time; in the second phase it becomes a species
                of jellyfish and the snakes in her hair attack us; Finally, her body becomes a statue and her head
                starts attacking us in a tunnel </h3>

            <h3>Pirate Captain Brineybeard and his Ship are very simple, at the beginning the boss's hitbox is concentrated
                all over the pirate's body,
                while attacking with different types of characters that emerge from the water; in the second and final phase, the Ship
                expels the Pirate from himself and starts attacking us with a laser</h3>

            <h3>In Sally Stageplay, a woman in a theater attacks us using her umbrella and jumping on our
                character; In the next phases the scenario changes, as in the second where she continues attacking
                while babies appear attacking us in the background; in the third she becomes a cardboard character and in the
                attacks with 3 different attacks; and finally she appears tied to a rope while the audience throws flowers
                that harm us</h3>

            <h3>As the last boss on this island, we have the Phantom Express. We battle against 4 horror characters with
                train theme, with a ghost that shoots out your eyes in the first phase; a skeleton driver in
                second; two brothers who attack us by shooting lightning from their mouths; and finally the train itself attacks us and
