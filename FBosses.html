                we defeat these secondary bosses, the fight against him is unlocked and he attacks us with cards, having
                a single attack</h3>

                        we will have to deal with very varied attacks. In its first phase, it shoots several types of
                        magic and can even become a spider; as a second phase it appears giant in the background while
                        attacks us with a flying ax and bombs; thirdly, two large demons appear spitting on the
                        player and a few other minors who attack in the air; when we defeat these minor characters, the
                        Devil starts crying in the background and his tears cause damage, being a phase in which he has little
                        life. By going through all this, we beat the Devil and ended the game</h3>
